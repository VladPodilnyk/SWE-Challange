# SWE Challange

The aim of the challange is to become a better software engineer by developing various projects from different areas of CS. While at the very begining it will be mostly about functional progdramming, Scala, web development and distributed systems, my goal is to cover another interesting for me areas like embedded systems, ML, game development and computer graphics. Anyway, the most important thing here is to have fun!

## Sandbox of project ideas

Due to the fact that I have not decided how the project list will look like, I've listed a few project that I'd like to work on. So for now, it's just a list of ideas that does not specify any order, but lately I'll come up with some structure.

1. Build an FTP-server
2. Build a simple OS (Rust + RaspberryPi, https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os)
3. Convey's game of life (my tribute to front-end)
4. Build a compiler of VM
5. Use twitter trands to define mood on Twitter (back + front + NLP)
6. Write a web scrapper (next level: use Spark to analyse the data)
7. Chat-app (yup, very creative, I know ...)
8. web-crawler
9. Bloom filter implementation
10. Labs + Project from http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2017/index.html (Distributed Sytems)
11. Bandwidth monitor or system monitory (will be in Golang probably)
12. Build own TCP/IP stack
13. Make interesting data viz
14. Implement an autopilot using simulator
15. game shaders (https://github.com/lettier/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners)
16. build a ray tracer. 
17. implement a simple DB.
18. implements a simple debugger.
19. Stock, currency info dashboard.
20. Music generator
21. and many more hopefuly... (https://github.com/kkdai/project52)
