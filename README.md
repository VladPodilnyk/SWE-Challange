# SWE Challenge

The aim of the challenge is to become a better software engineer by developing various projects from different areas of CS. While at the very begining it will be mostly about functional progdramming, Scala, web development and distributed systems, my goal is to cover another interesting for me areas like embedded systems, ML, game development and computer graphics. Anyway, the most important thing here is to have fun!

## Sandbox of project ideas

Due to the fact that I have not decided how the project list will look like, I've listed a few project that I'd like to work on. So for now, it's just a list of ideas that does not specify any order, but lately I'll come up with some structure.

1. Use twitter trends to define mood on Twitter (back + front + NLP) - [link to the project page](https://github.com/VladPodilnyk/twitter-mood)
2. Build a simple OS (Rust + RaspberryPi, https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os)
3. Convey's game of life + collision simulation using Laminar + Animus (should be awsome!)
4. Build a compiler or VM
5. Build an FTP-server
6. Write a web scrapper (next level: use Spark to analyse the data)
7. Hackers chat: chat on ws with CLI (super nerdy project)
8. web-crawler
9. Bloom filter implementation
10. Labs + Project from http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2017/index.html (Distributed Sytems)
11. Bandwidth monitor or system monitory (will be in Rust probably)
12. Build own TCP/IP stack
13. Make interesting data viz
14. Implement an autopilot using simulator (carla) 
15. game shaders (https://github.com/lettier/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners)
16. build a ray tracer. 
17. implement a simple DB.
18. implements a simple debugger.
19. Stock, currency info dashboard.
20. Music generator (probably using magenta)
21. and many more hopefuly... (https://github.com/kkdai/project52)
22. <spike project> *private* - convenient wrapper on C++ over OpenCL to work with N-dimensional data with ease.
23. a real time game based on reactive architecture (scala + monix): this idea is not formalised yet.
24. fs2-dataframe - a lib that helps working with data in pandas-like style using fs2 streams ?
25. redis based adaptive throttler
